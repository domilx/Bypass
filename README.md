# Bypass
Bypass Administrator on most exe files for windows.

Let's say you have a school computer and you dont have Admin, so you download Bypass.bat and the .exe that you want to run.

All you need to do is drag the said .exe on the Bypass.bat and it will bypass the admin prompt.

IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ALL EXECUTABLES!!!

If it's an installer make sure that the install path in wich you install the prgram you have rights over. 

Example your user directory.

If you find any issue or want to contribute code feel free to.
